# ColorGen
This is a random color generator app. It will display a random color in the background and have the RGB values of that color in the bottom left corner. There is a button to generate a new random color in the bottom right corner. You may also manually change the RGB values to change the color of the background.

I wrote this program for fun because I had the developmental environment for Andriod apps already on my computer.
